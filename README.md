# Statistics_from_Stock_Data

In this lab we will load stock data into a Pandas Dataframe and calculate some statistics on it. We will be working with stock data from Google, Apple, and Amazon. All the stock data was downloaded from yahoo finance in CSV format. In your workspace you should have a file named GOOG.csv containing the Google stock data, a file named AAPL.csv containing the Apple stock data, and a file named AMZN.csv containing the Amazon stock data. (You can see the workspace folder by clicking on the Jupyter logo in the upper left corner of the workspace.) All the files contain 7 columns of data:

Date | Open | High | Low | Close | Adj_Close | Volume

##### To Do:
****** Load the Google, Apple, Amazon stock data into a DataFrame.
